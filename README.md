# My No-Frills Notebook

This is a "notebook" of sorts, maybe part diary as well, that remains to be
seen. I plan to use it primarily (if not exclusively) for software, computing,
and computer science topics. I've experimented with a variety of different ways
of taking notes and capturing my thoughts in electronic form; generally, I've
favored [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) and more-recently [Emacs'
org-mode](https://orgmode.org/). But (at this point) my understanding of `org`
is still very basic, and I don't want to deal with any of the hosting solutions
for TiddyWiki instances.

So, I'll do it here, in Markdown. For now, at least.

In the future I may start writing primarily in `org` and exporting it to
Markdown, or even move to different format altogether
([Typst](https://typst.app/)? [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)?) Or I
may take one of the domains I'm currently not making use of and go full-on
blog.

The underlying tools are not the point, and not *that* important. But in that
vein, that majority of my coding and writing is done in Emacs, which will no
doubt guide my choice of other tools.

And maybe, no one else will ever read any of this anyway.
